# Neural-network-in-python
General purpose training of a neural network in python
Specify an arbitrary network architecture and train a neural network for multiclass classification, given matching data. Will use gradient descent for optimisation for now, updating to a better algorithm when needed.
Recommendations of optimisation algorithms and other changes would be appreciated.
